# gitmaker
A tool to creating gifs using a text file. This allows one to create a text file 
defining the gif instead of having to figure out how to create a gif in a
specific language.

## Usage
Run `go install github.com/moolmanruan/gifmaker@latest` to install the app.

Run `gifmaker input.txt output.gif` to create a gif.

Look at the `examples` directory for example inputs.
